# NetPractice - Networking Problem Solving

## Project Overview

**NetPractice** is a system administration project that introduces the fundamentals of networking. Through this project, I solved various networking issues, specifically focusing on configuring small-scale networks. The project is designed to help understand how TCP/IP addressing works and to apply this knowledge by configuring virtual network diagrams to function correctly.

The project consists of 10 levels, each presenting a unique networking problem to solve. The goal of each level is to configure the network so that it works as intended, addressing issues like IP addressing, routing, and subnetting.

## Key Features

- **Project Type**: System administration exercise.
- **Objective**: Configure networks by solving issues related to TCP/IP addressing and routing.
- **Levels**: The project contains 10 levels, each with a non-functioning network diagram that must be corrected.

---

## Technical Details

- **Network Configuration**: Each level presents a network that needs to be configured correctly by modifying IP addresses, subnets, and routing settings.
- **Web-Based Interface**: The network configurations are done through a web-based interface provided by the project. The interface allows you to:
  - **Check configurations**: Verify if the network is correctly configured.
  - **Export configurations**: Export your configurations to be submitted as part of the project.

- **Logs and Debugging**: Logs are provided in the web interface to help identify errors in the network configuration.

### Example:
For each level, a non-functioning network diagram is displayed, and you must modify the configuration fields until the network is fully functional. Common tasks include:
- Configuring correct IP addresses and subnet masks.
- Setting up routing tables to ensure proper network communication.
- Verifying connectivity across devices such as routers and computers.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **TCP/IP Addressing**: Gained a deep understanding of IP addresses, subnetting, and routing protocols in small networks.
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Applied knowledge of network protocols to troubleshoot and resolve issues in virtual network configurations.
- **Configuration Management**: Used a web-based tool to configure network settings and export configurations for submission.
- **System Administration**: Developed skills in managing and configuring network infrastructure, critical for future system and network administration tasks.

## Conclusion

The **NetPractice** project provided a solid introduction to networking concepts, specifically TCP/IP addressing and routing. By configuring and troubleshooting virtual networks, I gained valuable skills in network administration, which are essential for any system administrator. The projectâ€™s hands-on approach allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my understanding of how networks function in real-world environments.
